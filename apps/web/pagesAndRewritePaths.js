// It would match /free/30min but not /bookings/upcoming because 'bookings' is an item in pages
// It would also not match /free/30min/embed because we are ensuring just two slashes
// ?!book ensures it doesn't match /free/book page which doesn't have a corresponding new-booker page.
// [^/]+ makes the RegExp match the full path, it seems like a partial match doesn't work.
// book$ ensures that only /book is excluded from rewrite(which is at the end always) and not /booked
