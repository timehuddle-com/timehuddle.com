# Embeds

This folder contains all the various flavours of embeds.

`core` contains the core library written in vanilla JS that manages the embed.
`snippet` contains the Vanilla JS Code Snippet that can be installed on any website and would automatically fetch the `core` library.

Please see the respective folder READMEs for details on them.

## Publishing to NPM. It will soon be automated using changesets github action

To publish the packages. Following steps should be followed. All commands are to be run at the root.

1. `yarn changeset` -> Creates changelog files and adds summary to changelog. Select embed packages only here.
2. `yarn changeset version` -> Bumps the versions as required
3. Get the PR reviewed and merged
4. `yarn publish-embed` -> Releases all packages. We can't use `yarn changeset publish` because it doesn't support workspace: prefix removal yet. See https://github.com/changesets/changesets/issues/432#issuecomment-1016365428
